* Power supply (5V 3A and above recommended)
* Heatsink case
* 16GB SDcard (minimum)
* [(USB SSD to run a pruned bitcoin node locally)](FAQ.md#usb-ssd-recommendation)
* [other tested hardware ](#tested-environments)
  
**JoininBox operates on the minimum viable hardware under the assumption that the seed (and passphrase) of the wallets used is safely backed up and can be used to recover the funds!**

### Set up with an SDcard image
* Find the links to the prebuilt image in the [releases](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/releases)
* [Verify the downloaded image](FAQ.md#verify-the-downloaded-the-image)
* Write to the SDcard with [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
* Assemble the RaspberryPi and connect with a LAN cable to the internet
* Make sure that your laptop and the RPi are on the same local network
* Boot by connecting the power cable
* Open a terminal ([OSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)/[Win10](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/)) and connect with ssh.  
  Use the hostname of the latest SDcard image (`rpi4-20210210`) or to find the IP address to connect to:  
  * scan with the [AngryIP Scanner](https://angryip.org/)
  * use `sudo arp -a` or
  * check the router interface 

  `ssh joinmarket@rpi4-20210210` â†’ use the password: `joininbox`
