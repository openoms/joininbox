## Features

* Send transactions with improved privacy using CoinJoin and PayJoin
* Run the Yield Generator as a service and earn fees for providing liquidity
* Use the JoinMarket-QT GUI remotely over SSH
* Signet support to test for free
* Connect remotely to a Bitcoin Core node
  * RaspiBlitz over [LAN or Tor](prepare_remote_node.md#raspiblitz)
  * RoninDojo over [LAN or Tor](prepare_remote_node.md#ronindojo)
* Start a pruned node from https://prunednode.today/
* JoininBox is part the RaspiBlitz SERVICES

**The addresses, transactions and balances of JoinMarket can be seen in the watch-only wallet of the connected node.**
  * use your own or a trusted node
  * to protect privacy in case of physical access use disk encryption

## Required Hardware
* RaspberryPi 4 ([alternatively any other computer running a Debian Linux flavour](#tested-environments))
* Power supply (5V 3A and above recommended)
* Heatsink case
* 16GB SDcard (minimum) - 32GB to use a pruned node
* [(USB SSD to run a pruned bitcoin node locally)](FAQ.md#usb-ssd-recommendation)
* [other tested hardware ](#tested-environments)

**JoininBox operates on the minimum viable hardware under the assumption that the seed (and passphrase) of the wallets used is safely backed up and can be used to recover the funds!**

## Set up using an SDcard image
* Download the zip of the latest successful SDcard image build for the Raspberry Pi 4 or 3 from  
  <https://github.com/openoms/joininbox/actions?query=workflow%3Aarm64-rpi-image-build++branch%3Amaster+is%3Asuccess++>  
  (note that need to be logged in to github to download the artifact image file)
* unzip and check the sha256sum verifying the .gz file integrity
  ```
  sha256sum -c joininbox-arm64-rpi.img.gz.sha256
  joininbox-arm64-rpi.img.gz: OK
  ```

* Write the joininbox-arm64-rpi.img.gz file to the SDcard with [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) - no need to decompress further
* Assemble the RaspberryPi and connect with a LAN cable to the internet
* Make sure that your laptop and the RPi are on the same local network
* Boot by connecting the power cable
* Open a terminal ([OSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)/[Win10](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/)) and connect with ssh:
  ```
  ssh joinmarket@rpi4-20220121
  ```
   â†’ the password on the first boot is: `joininbox`
* Use the hostname of the latest SDcard image (`rpi4-20220121`) or to find the IP address to connect to:  
  * scan with the [AngryIP Scanner](https://angryip.org/)
  * use `sudo arp -a` or
  * check the router interface

* after the first login will be prompted to change the password to access the menu.
  ![password change](/images/password.change.png)

* next will be presented with the CONFIG menu to
  * Connect to a remote bitcoin node on mainnet
  * Try JoinMarket on signet
  * Start a pruned node from [prunednode.today](https://prunednode.today)
  * Edit the joinmarket.cfg manually
  * Update JoininBox or JoinMarket

  ![config menu](/images/menu.startup.png)

* Update to the latest version of JoininBox and update JoinMarket if the latest version is newer than the one installed on the SDcard

  After any of the options or Exit is selected the main JoininBox menu will open where you can start using JoinMarket
