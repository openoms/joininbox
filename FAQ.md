### SSH through Tor from Linux
On a RaspiBlitz
* since v1.4 there is a script to create a hidden service on your blitz:  
`./config.scripts/internet.hiddenservice.sh ssh 22 22`  
* get the Hidden Service address to connect to with:  
`sudo cat /mnt/hdd/tor/ssh/hostname`  

On the Debian based Linux Desktop (Ubuntu, Debian, MX Linux etc.)
* needs Tor running on your desktop:  
`sudo apt install tor`
* might need to add:  
`sudo apt install torsocks` 

* edit the Tor config file:  
`sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`
* add:
    ```
    # Hidden Service for ssh
    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh
    HiddenServiceVersion 3
    HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
    ```
* Restart Tor:  
`sudo systemctl restart tor`
* get the Hidden Service address to connect to with:  
`sudo cat /mnt/hdd/tor/ssh/hostname`  

Use `ssh` with `torify`  on the desktop (needs Tor installed):  
`torify ssh admin@HiddenServiceAddress.onion`

### Allow Tor to connect to localhost

* To solve the error when running `$ torify python yg-privacyenhanced.py wallet.jmdat`
    ```
    [INFO]  starting yield generator
    [INFO]  Listening on port 27183
    [INFO]  Starting transaction monitor in walletservice
    1580214062 WARNING torsocks[28563]: [connect] Connection to a local address are     denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for    safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:192)
    ```

* Edit the `torsocks.conf` and activate the option `AllowOutboundLocalhost 1`:  
`$ sudo nano /etc/tor/torsocks.conf`

    ```
    # Set Torsocks to allow outbound connections to the loopback interface.
    # If set to 1, connect() will be allowed to be used to the loopback interface
    # bypassing Tor. If set to 2, in addition to TCP connect(), UDP operations to
    # the loopback interface will also be allowed, bypassing Tor. This option
    # should not be used by most users. (Default: 0)
    AllowOutboundLocalhost 1
    ```

* Restart Tor:   
`sudo systemctl restart tor`

### Set up Armbian on the Hardkernel Odroid XU4
* Download the SDcard image  
https://dl.armbian.com/odroidxu4/Buster_legacy  
* Verify  
https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#how-to-check-download-authenticity

    ```
    $ gpg --verify Armbian_20.02.0-rc0_Odroidxu4_buster_legacy_4.14.165.img.asc
    gpg: assuming signed data in 'Armbian_20.02.0-rc0_Odroidxu4_buster_legacy_4.14.165.img'

    ```

* Preparation  
    Make sure you have a good & reliable SD card and a proper power supply. Archives can be uncompressed with 7-Zip on Windows, Keka on OS X and 7z on Linux (apt-get install p7zip-full). RAW images can be written with Etcher (all OS).

* Boot  
    Insert the SD card into the slot, connect a cable to your network if possible or a display and power your board. (First) boot (with DHCP) takes up to 35 seconds with a class 10 SD Card.

* Login  
    Log in as: root  Password: 1234. Then you are prompted to change this password (US-Keyboard setting). When done, you are asked to create a normal user-account for your everyday tasks.

* Change the password.
* Create a new user called `joinmarket` and set the password.  
 Keep pressing [ENTER] to use the default user information.

### Download and verify Raspbian SDcard image for a Raspberry Pi

To be able to open the JoinMarket-QT GUI on the dekstop from the RPI
need to use the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop inage

* Download image:  
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2020-05-28/2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip
* Download signature:  
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2020-05-28/2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip.sig

* Import PGP pubkey:  
`curl https://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberrypi_downloads.gpg.key | gpg --import`

* Verify the image:  
`gpg --verify 2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip.sig`

* Flash the image to an SDcard, can use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)

* put a file called simply: `ssh` to the root of the sdcard.  
Read more on [how to gain ssh access here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

* boot up the RPi and log in with ssh to:   
`pi@LAN_IP_ADDRESS`  
The default password is: `raspberry`

### Log in through SSH using a hardware wallet

* See the official pages for:
    * [Trezor](https://wiki.trezor.io/Apps:SSH_agent)
    * [Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005200649)

* Linux client for [TREZOR One](https://trezor.io/), [TREZOR Model T](https://trezor.io/), [Keepkey](https://www.keepkey.com/), and [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s):
    * [github.com/romanz/trezor-agent](https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent/blob/master/doc/README-SSH.md)

* Windows client for Trezor and Keepkey:
    * <https://github.com/martin-lizner/trezor-ssh-agent>

* paste the generated SSH pubkey to:  
`$ nano /home/joinmarket/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### Error when connecting to a full node remotely through Tor
* Getting the error:
    ```
    socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
    ```
* Remember to use `torify` with the python scripts when connecting remotely through Tor. Example:  
    `torify wallet-tool.py wallet.jmdat`

### Nuke the joinmarket user and the /home/joinmarket folder
`sudo userdel -r joinmarket`

### Compile Tor for the RPi Zero (armv6l)

https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/debian#source

### Build the SDcard image

#### Boot Tails: https://tails.boum.org/
#### Download,verify and flash the base image to the SDcard 
* Image: https://raspi.debian.net/verified/20201112_raspi_4.img.xz
* Signature: https://raspi.debian.net/verified/20201112_raspi_4.xz.sha256.asc

    ```bash
    gpg --receive-key 60B3093D96108E5CB97142EFE2F63B4353F45989
    gpg --verify 20201112_raspi_4.xz.sha256.asc
    ```

* Flash it to the SDcard with Balena Etcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/
#### Prepare the base image

* before the first boot edit the `sysconf.txt` on the RASPIFIRM partition to be able to ssh remotely - needs an authorized ssh pubkey. Get it from the Tails terminal with:  
`cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`

* Boot the RPi and connect with ssh. Find the IP on the router's dashboard if using the hostname does not work.
    ```bash
    ssh root@rpi4-20201112
    ```

* install basic dependencies, upgrade and reboot
    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install sudo wget
    apt upgrade
    reboot
    ``` 
#### Install Joininbox
* Connect with ssh
    ```bash
    ssh root@rpi4-20201112
    ```
* Download and run the build script
  ```bash 
  # download
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openoms/joininbox/master/build_joininbox.sh
  # inspect the script
  cat build_joininbox.sh
  # run
  sudo bash build_joininbox.sh
  ```

#### Prepare the SDcard release
 * Make the SDcard image safe to share by removing unique infos like ssh pubkeys and network identifiers:  
     ```bash
    /home/joinmarket/prepare.release.sh
    ```
