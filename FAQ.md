## SSH hardening options

### SSH key authentication
* <https://raspibolt.org/guide/raspberry-pi/security.html#login-with-ssh-keys>

### 2FA with TOTP
* Detailed guide: <https://pimylifeup.com/setup-2fa-ssh/>  
* See all the options at: <https://www.mankier.com/1/google-authenticator#Options>
* Commands:
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
  google-authenticator --time-based --force --disallow-reuse --qr-mode=UTF8 --rate-limit=3 --rate-time=30 --window-size=3

  echo "auth required pam_google_authenticator.so" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd

  sudo sed -i "s/^ChallengeResponseAuthentication no/ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes/g" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```
* test without exiting first by connecting to the localhost:  
`ssh joinmarket@127.0.0.1`
*  verify that the login with paasword and 2FA works before exiting the terminal

* Set 2FA up for ssh key authentication:
  ```
  sudo sed -i "s/^@include common-auth/#@include common-auth/g" /etc/pam.d/sshd
  echo "AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```

### 2FA with Yubikey
* for recent linux and Mac clients
* based on https://rameerez.com/how-to-use-yubikey-to-log-in-via-ssh-to-server/
  ```
  # Check the OpenSSH version is above: 8.2 (https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2)
  ssh -V

  # Check is allowed to generate -sk (security key) type keys (see the article above for Mac) 
  ssh-keygen help
  # should show the line:  [-t dsa | ecdsa | ecdsa-sk | ed25519 | ed25519-sk | rsa]

  # generate key
  ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/yubikey

  # copy with:
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/yubikey user@host
  # or display to be copied manually to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server:
  cat ~/.ssh/yubikey.pub
  ```

### Log in through SSH using a hardware wallet
* See the official pages for:
    * [Trezor](https://wiki.trezor.io/Apps:SSH_agent)
    * [Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005200649)
* Linux client for [TREZOR One](https://trezor.io/), [TREZOR Model T](https://trezor.io/), [Keepkey](https://www.keepkey.com/), and [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s):
    * [github.com/romanz/trezor-agent](https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent/blob/master/doc/README-SSH.md)
* Windows client for Trezor and Keepkey:
    * <https://github.com/martin-lizner/trezor-ssh-agent>
* paste the generated SSH pubkey to:  
`$ nano /home/joinmarket/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## SSH through Tor from Linux
On a RaspiBlitz
* use the existing script to create a hidden service on your blitz:  
`./config.scripts/tor.onion-service.sh ssh 22 22`  
* get the Hidden Service address to connect to with:  
`sudo cat /mnt/hdd/tor/ssh/hostname`  

On a Debian based Linux Desktop (Ubuntu, Debian, MX Linux etc.)
* needs Tor running on your desktop:  
`sudo apt-get install tor`
* might need to add:  
`sudo apt-get install torsocks` 

* edit the Tor config file:  
`sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`
* add:
    ```
    # Hidden Service for ssh
    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh
    HiddenServiceVersion 3
    HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
    ```
* Restart Tor:  
`sudo systemctl restart tor`
* get the Hidden Service address to connect to with:  
`sudo cat /mnt/hdd/tor/ssh/hostname`  

Use `ssh` with `torsocks`  on the desktop (needs Tor installed):  
`torsocks ssh admin@HiddenServiceAddress.onion`

## Allow Tor to connect to localhost
* To solve the error when running `$ torsocks python yg-privacyenhanced.py wallet.jmdat`
    ```
    [INFO]  starting yield generator
    [INFO]  Listening on port 27183
    [INFO]  Starting transaction monitor in walletservice
    1580214062 WARNING torsocks[28563]: [connect] Connection to a local address are     denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for    safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:192)
    ```

* Edit the `torsocks.conf` and activate the option `AllowOutboundLocalhost 1`:  
`$ sudo nano /etc/tor/torsocks.conf`

    ```
    # Set Torsocks to allow outbound connections to the loopback interface.
    # If set to 1, connect() will be allowed to be used to the loopback interface
    # bypassing Tor. If set to 2, in addition to TCP connect(), UDP operations to
    # the loopback interface will also be allowed, bypassing Tor. This option
    # should not be used by most users. (Default: 0)
    AllowOutboundLocalhost 1
    ```

* Restart Tor:   
`sudo systemctl restart tor`

## Set up Armbian on the Hardkernel Odroid HC1 / XU4
* Download the base image (`.img.gz`), the `.sha` and `.asc` file
https://www.armbian.com/odroid-xu4/
* Verify: https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#how-to-check-download-authenticity
    ```bash
    gpg --keyserver ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key DF00FAF1C577104B50BF1D0093D6889F9F0E78D5

    ```
* Preparation  
    Make sure you have a good & reliable SD card and a proper power supply. Archives can be uncompressed with 7-Zip on Windows, Keka on OS X and 7z on Linux (apt-get install p7zip-full). RAW images can be written with Etcher (all OS).
* Boot  
    Insert the SD card into the slot, connect a cable to your network if possible or a display and power your board. (First) boot (with DHCP) takes up to 35 seconds with a class 10 SD Card.
* Login  
    Log in as: `root`  Password: `1234`. Then you are prompted to change this password (US-Keyboard setting). When done, you are asked to create a normal user-account for your everyday tasks.
* Change the password.
* Create a new user called `joinmarket` and set the password (the password will be changed to `joininbox`).  
 Keep pressing [ENTER] to use the default user information.
* Continue to [install JoininBox](README.md#install-joininbox)

## Download and verify Raspbian SDcard image for a Raspberry Pi
To be able to open the JoinMarket-QT GUI on the desktop from the RPI
need to use the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop image
* Download image:  
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2020-05-28/2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip
* Download signature:  
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2020-05-28/2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip.sig
* Import PGP pubkey:  
`curl https://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberrypi_downloads.gpg.key | gpg --import`
* Verify the image:  
`gpg --verify 2020-05-27-raspios-buster-armhf.zip.sig`
* Flash the image to an SDcard, can use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
* put a file called simply: `ssh` to the root of the sdcard.  
Read more on [how to gain ssh access here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).
* boot up the RPi and log in with ssh to:   
`pi@LAN_IP_ADDRESS`  
The default password is: `raspberry`
* Continue to [install JoininBox](README.md#install-joininbox)

## Error when connecting to a full node remotely through Tor
* Getting the error:
    ```
    socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
    ```
* Remember to use `torsocks` with the python scripts when connecting remotely through Tor. Example:  
    `torsocks wallet-tool.py wallet.jmdat`

## Erase the joinmarket user and the /home/joinmarket folder
`sudo srm -rf /home/joinmarket/`  
`sudo userdel -rf joinmarket`

## Compile Tor for the RPi Zero (armv6l)
https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/debian#source

## Build the SDcard image
* Partially based on: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/v1.6/FAQ.md#what-is-the-process-of-creating-a-new-sd-card-image-release

### Boot Ubuntu Live from USB: https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/ubuntu-20.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso
* Connect to a secure WiFi (hardware switch on) or LAN
  
### Download and verify the base image
* Open a terminal
* Paste the following commands (see the comments for the explanations and an example output)
    ```bash  
    # Download the base image:
    wget https://raspi.debian.net/verified/20210210_raspi_4_buster.img.xz

    # Download the PGP signed sha256 hash
    wget https://raspi.debian.net/verified/20210210_raspi_4_buster.xz.sha256.asc

    # Verify:

    # Primary key fingerprint: 4D14 0506 53A4 02D7 3687  049D 2404 C954 6E14 5360
    #     Subkey fingerprint: 60B3 093D 9610 8E5C B971  42EF E2F6 3B43 53F4 5989

    # compare the hash to the hash of the image file
    sha256sum --check 20210210_raspi_4_buster.xz.sha256.asc
    # Look for the output 'OK':
    # 20201112_raspi_4.img.xz: OK
    # sha256sum: WARNING: 10 lines are improperly formatted
    ```
### Flash the base image to the SDcard
* Connect an SDcard reader with a 8GB SDcard.
* In the file manager open the context menu (right click) on the `.img.xz` file.
* Select the option `Open With Disk Image Writer`.
* Write the image to the SDcard.
### Prepare the base image

* Before the first boot edit the `sysconf.txt` on the `RASPIFIRM` partition to be able to ssh remotely - needs an authorized ssh pubkey.
* Generate ssh keys on Ubuntu with (keep selecting the defaults with ENTER):
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```
* Click on the RASPIFIRM volume once in the file manager to mount it
* Copy the ssh pubkey from the Ubuntu image to the `sysconf.txt` the `RASPIFIRM` directory (make sure it is mounted):
    ```bash
    echo "root_authorized_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" | tee -a /media/ubuntu/RASPIFIRM/sysconf.txt
    # Check with:
    cat /media/ubuntu/RASPIFIRM/sysconf.txt
    ```   
    The `sysconf.txt` will reset after boot and moves the ssh pubkey to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
* Place the SDcard in the RPi, boot up and connect with ssh (use the hostname, `arp -a` or check the router)
    ```bash
    ssh root@rpi4-20210210
    ```
* Install basic dependencies
    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install sudo wget
    ```
### Install Joininbox
* Download and run the build script
  ```bash 
  # download
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openoms/joininbox/master/build_joininbox.sh
  # inspect the script
  cat build_joininbox.sh
  # run
  sudo bash build_joininbox.sh
  ```
* Monitor/Check outputs for warnings/errors

### Prepare the SDcard release
 * Make the SDcard image safe to share by removing unique infos like ssh pubkeys and network identifiers:  
     ```bash
    /home/joinmarket/standalone/prepare.release.sh
    ```
* Disconnect WiFi/LAN on build laptop (hardware switch off) and shutdown
* Remove Ubuntu LIVE USB stick and cut power from the RaspberryPi

### Sign the image on an airgapped computer
* Connect USB stick with [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) (stay offline)
* Power on the Build Laptop (press F12 for boot menu)
* Connect USB stick with GPG signing keys - decrypt drive if needed
* Open Terminal and cd into directory of USB Stick under `/media/amnesia`
* Run `gpg --import backupsecretkey.gpg`, check and `exit`
* Disconnect USB stick with GPG keys
* Take the SD card from the RaspberryPi and connect with an external SD card reader to the laptop
* Click on the RASPIFIRM volume once in the file manager to mount it
* Connect another USB stick, open in file manager and delete old files
* Open Terminal and cd into directory of USB stick under `/media/amnesia`
* Run `lsblk` to check on the SD card device name (ignore last partition number)
* Clone the SDcard:   
  `dd if=/dev/[sdcarddevice] | gzip > joininbox-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz`
* When finished you should see that more than 7GB was copied.
* Create sha256 hash of the image:  
  `sha256sum *.gz > joininbox-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256`
* Sign the sha256 hash file:  
  `gpg --detach-sign --armor *.sha256`
* Check the files:
  ```bash
  ls
    joininbox-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz
    joininbox-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256
    joininbox-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256.asc
  ```
* Shutdown the build computer
* Upload the new image to server - put the .sig file and sha256sum.txt next to it
* Copy the sha256sum to GitHub README and update the download link

## Verify the downloaded the image
### Linux instructions

* Connect the remote bitcoind with `CONFIG` -> `CONNECT` menu so it checks if the connection is successful. It will also set the remote watch-only wallet in bitcoind to "joininbox" so will need to rescan that after recovering an old wallet with previously used addresses.

* When using the CLI and connecting to the remote node over Tor, you will need to use the script with the torsocks prefix like:  
`torsocks python3 wallet-tool.py --recoversync -g 20 ~/.joinmarket/wallets/wallet.jmdat`

### on the remote node
* Use the menu option `WALLET` -> `RESCAN` or follow manually
* the wallet defined as
`rpc_wallet =`
in the joinmarket.cfg is the wallet which is used as watch only in the remote bitcoind.
You need to run rescanblockchain on that wallet in bitcoind after importing the joinmarket wallet.
* The wallet is set in the joinmarket.cfg (by default called `joininbox` should show up when you run:  
`bitcoin-cli listwallets`

* To rescan on the node run (https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/rescanblockchain.html?highlight=rescanblockchain):  
`bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=joininbox rescanblockchain 477120`  
Rescanning from the first SegWit block is sufficient for the default SegWit wallets.

* Monitor progress (on a RaspiBlitz):  
`sudo tail -fn 100 /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/debug.log`  
Once the rescan is finished you balances should appear in the `INFO` menu (`wallet-tool.py`)
## USB SSD recommendation
**JoininBox operates on the minimum viable hardware under the assumption that the seed (and passphrase) of the wallets used is safely backed up and can be recovered fully**
* The above warning is especially true for SDcard as they fail often, use a good quality one.
* If using an external USB drive I recommend using a Sandisk Extreme Pro 128GB USB SSD:
https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1362486943301459968
* a good alternative is a USB connector and internal SSD as in the [RaspiBlitz shopping list](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#package-standard-around-250-usd). Pay attention to choose a compatible SATA-USB adapter since that is a common problem with the Raspberry Pi 4.
* Cheap USB drives are very likely to fail after weeks of heavy usage: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/924

## Pruned node notes
It is only recommended to create a new wallet on a pruned node.
Importing an old wallet is not possible without downloading the whole blockchain again (would be too slow and unreliable when using an SDcard only).

To recover a wallet one will need to connect to a node without pruning switched on and rescan there.
When the funds are recovered they can be sent to the addresses created with a new wallet started on a pruned node.

## External drive
Alternatively to a pruned node there could be a larger >400 GB storage connected and mounted on the standalone JoininBox with the `.bitcoin` directory containing the `blocks` and `chainstate` symlinked to `/home/store/app-data/` and owned by the `bitcoin` user.

## Install JoinMarket without the QT GUI and dependencies
* Run the build script with the options `BRANCH` `GITHUBUSER` `without-qt`:
  ```
  sudo bash build_joininbox.sh openoms master without-qt
  ```
* or in the JoininBox terminal install JoinMarket with the option `--qtgui false`:
  ```
  /home/joinmarket/install.joinmarket.sh --qtgui false
  ```

## Run the JoinMarket-QT GUI from a different user on the same Linux desktop where JoininBox is installed

* To disable the display access control of the xserver open a new terminal on the desktop and type:
  ```
  xhost +
  ```
* use the shortcut in the JoininBox terminal to open the JoinMarket-QT GUI:
  ```
  qtgui
  ```
* re-enable the access control with:
  ```
  xhost -
  ```
## Install Jam on a linux desktop and connect to a remote Joininbox
* described in [scripts/jam-remote/README.txt](scripts/jam-remote/README.txt)

## Signing strategy for releases
From: https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam/issues/142#issuecomment-1109780879
* Instead of creating the release tag using the GitHub UI, the signer creates it on his machine and pushes it to GitHub via: git tag -s v0.7.4 && git push origin v0.7.4. More infos on signing tags and setting up GPG with Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work).
* The signer creates a [release from the signed tag using the GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) with changelog, rich title, etc. just like we had it for the past releases.
